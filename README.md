# nebula-gdb
For now there are only two kinds of pretty printers for C++ STL and Nebula Graph(`nebula::Value`). In future we may add some other extentions for better debugging.

## Usage
Clone this repo, then `source` the `nebula-gdb.py` file from within `$HOME/.gdbinit` for personal use, or `/etc/gdbinit` for system wide use (or `etc/gdb/gdbinit` for Debian derivatives).
